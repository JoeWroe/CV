#Joe Wroe - Lego Artisan

Recently graduating from the intensive Makers Academy, Learn to Code course, honed my personality into that of a builder and a learner. When recently asked what that meant I'd achieved, my reply was that Makers Academy had allowed me to fill an enormous box of Lego, desperate to play and build structures with that Lego, all that was needed now was the perfect environment of like minded people who would dive into that box with me and maximize the incredible potential that is at our fingertips.

##Skills
###Builder
Some of my earliest memories are from before the start of school as a young kid, having woken up 3 or 4 hours early just to play with my Lego. This was my initial foray into building my own things, from scratch. From there progression to University which saw the completion of a degree in actual construction and engineering, which lead to a year working for a large contractor. Following that, a move to London saw me undertake a job in International Finance for a small company, where the everyday challenge of helping build the company up and physically see the progress and evolution from decisions kept my passion for construction alive.

My time with the large contractor saw my team win 4 Environment Agency contracts and become one of the few initial testers of a new piece of software called QS Cad, which is used much more widely throughout the industry nowadays. Whilst working for the young Financial company, the two person team I lead managed to double the amount of completed business from two of our key partners in France.
