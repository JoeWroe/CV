#Joe Wroe - Lego Artisan

Recently graduating from the intensive Makers Academy, Learn to Code course, honed my personality into that of a builder and a learner. When recently asked what had been achieved there, my reply was that 'Makers Academy had allowed me to fill an enormous box of Lego, desperate to now play and build structures with that Lego, all that was needed was the perfect environment of like minded people who would dive into that box with me and maximize the incredible potential that is at our fingertips.

##Skills
####Builder
Some of my earliest memories are from before the start of school, as a young kid, having woken up 3 or 4 hours early just to play with my Lego. This was an initial foray into building things of my own. That passion for constructing the objects used and interacted with everyday has followed me throughout life and led to many of my proudest achievements.

- My time with a large construction contractor saw my team become one of the few initial testers of a new piece of software called QS Cad, the feedback we provided saw its use grow throughout the industry.
- Whilst working for a young International Financial Broker, the two person team I lead managed to double the amount of completed business from two of our key partners in France and build relationships with the likes of Knight Frank and UBS.
- More recently, the startup bank 'Mondo' asked for participation as a Alpha user of their product. My regular contributions and feedback can be seen on their forum.

My experience as a builder comes from undertaking a degree with the Built Environment School at university, which directly led to a year with a large civil construction contractor. From there, 2 years where spent helping building the young financial brokerage, where the day-to-day challenge and chance to physically see the progress and evolution from decisions was my biggest motivator.
