#Joe Wroe - Lego Artisan

Recently graduating from Makers Academy has further improved the builder learner aspects of my personality. Makers Academy has allowed me to fill an enormous box with Lego. Now desperate to play and build structures with this Lego, all that is needed is the perfect environment of like minded people, ready to dive into that box with me and maximize the incredible potential at our fingertips.

##Skills
####Builder
My earliest memory is of waking up 3 or 4 hours before school, just to play with Lego. This first foray into building objects of my own led to a passion for constructing the usable and has followed me throughout life, leading to many of my proudest professional achievements.

- Our team at Jackson Civil Engineering was one of the few initial testers of a new piece of software called QS Cad. The feedback we provided saw its use grow throughout the industry.
- Working for a young International Financial Broker I doubled the amount of business from two key partners in France. The two man team I led built company relationships with Zoopla and strengthened relationships with the likes of Knight Frank and UBS.
- More recently, the startup bank 'Mondo' has asked for my participation as an Alpha user of their product. Regular contributions and feedback can be seen on their forum.

#####Current Open Source Developer Projects

- Personal website for a friend: https://github.com/JoeWroe/nathalie-smith
- Website for a local homeless charity: https://github.com/JoeWroe/CLRSC

####Learner
Since a young age, the practical learning experience has been a key driver. Never settling for what I already know, my desire to learn and formulate knowledgable opinions cannot be underestimated. It is my firmly held belief that all opinions should be flexible in the face of new ideas.

- Alongside coding, the past two years have seen me gain skills in Music Production, Saxophone, Ballet, Bikram Yoga, Agile Working and Basic French.
- At University I was a member of 1st team Boxing, and also practised with Ice Hockey, Lacrosse and Dance teams.
- Whilst working for Jackson Civil Engineering the lead on software testing, mentioned above, was made my responsibility due to the speed with which I picked it up.

####Helper
If asked the most influential aspect of my life, without doubt the answer is the time I spend mentoring a young boy as an Independent Volunteer through Barnardo's. There is nothing more important to me than seeing this young man, who is currently in foster care, make a success of himself.

- The nomination and subsequent award for the UK's top Independent Volunteers with Young People was the proudest moment of my life.
- As well as working with Barnardo's, mentoring through the Nottingham Business School is also of great value.
