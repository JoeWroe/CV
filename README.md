#Joe Wroe - Lego Artisan

Recently graduating from the intensive Makers Academy - Learn to code course, honed my personality into that of a builder and a learner. When recently asked what that meant I'd achieved, my reply was that Makers Academy had allowed me to fill an enormous box of Lego, desperate to play and build structures with that Lego, all that was needed now was the perfect environment of like minded people who would dive into that box with me and maximize the incredible potential that is at our fingertips.
