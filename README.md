#Joe Wroe - Lego Artisan

Recently graduating from Makers Academy honed my personality into that of a builder and a learner. Makers Academy has allowed me to fill an enormous box of Lego, desperate to now play and build structures with that Lego, all that is needed is the perfect environment of like minded people who would dive into that box with me and maximize the incredible potential that is at our fingertips.

##Skills
####Builder
Some of my earliest memories are as a young kid, waking up 3 or 4 hours before school just to play with Lego. This was an initial foray into building things of my own. That passion for constructing the objects used and interacted with everyday has followed me throughout life and led to many of my proudest professional achievements.

- My time with a large construction contractor saw my team become one of the few initial testers of a new piece of software called QS Cad, the feedback we provided saw its use grow throughout the industry.
- Whilst working for a young International Financial Broker, the two person team I lead managed to double the amount of completed business from two of our key partners in France and build relationships with the likes of Knight Frank and UBS.
- More recently, the startup bank 'Mondo' asked for participation as a Alpha user of their product. My regular contributions and feedback can be seen on their forum.

My experience as a builder comes from undertaking a degree with the Built Environment School at university, which directly led to a year with a large civil construction contractor. From there, 2 years were spent helping building the young financial brokerage, where the day-to-day challenge and chance to physically see the progress and evolution from decisions was my biggest motivator.

####Learner
From a young age, learning new skills has been a driver for me. Never settling for what I already know, my desire to pick up new skills and formulate knowledgable opinions cannot be underestimated. It is also a firmly held belief that all opinions, especially my own, should be able to change given future learning.

- Apart from coding, in the past two years alone, new skills have included Saxophone, Music Production, Ballet, Bikram Yoga, Agile Working, Basic French.
- University saw me join numerous teams in order to learn new sports including Boxing, Ice Hockey, Lacrosse and Dance.
- Whilst working in construction, the lead on the software testing mentioned above, was given to me due to the speed I picked it up at.

####Helper
When asked what the most important thing in my life is, the answer is without doubt, the young kid I spend time mentoring once a month as an Independent Volunteer through Barnardo's. Having been given a tough start in life, there is nothing more essential to me than seeing the young man, who is currently in foster care, make a success of himself.

- The nomination and award for the UK's top Independent Volunteers with Young People was the proudest moment of my life.
- Apart from work with Barnardo's, work for the Nottingham Business School as a mentor of there students is crucial to me.
